# wakescrape
Just scraping the public housing records for fun
Pretty basic stuff. Uses curl and BeautifulSoup to scrape the wake county houing public records and then convert them into json format.
Right now it only supports the Account Summary page but I plan on adding the rest later.
On top of that ill probably add threads too but I would like to watch a movie now :)

...that movie plan was a lie. Anyways mostly finished. Just have to add the ability to visit more pages if they exist on a tab.

to run:
python scraper.py

must have dir called house in the src of this program for it to run
